				<h1>Knowing this, how can some people see others for their blood and not their character, when it's been proven that anybody can do morally questionable deeds regardless of heritage? Today, due to all of these events Somalia is having trouble dealing with a drought, and due to their being no effective central government there is not nearly enough aid being provided to the now impoverished civilians. The actions of both the rebel forces and Barre's government caused this unfortunate outcome, resulting in the crisis of today</h1>
